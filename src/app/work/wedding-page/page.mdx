## Overview

This project was created with SvelteKit and Cloudflare to serve as a dynamic, personalized wedding invitation. Each invitation is unique and tailored to the recipient, with the invitation number sourced from a Cloudflare database. The website features a countdown timer that adds a special touch to the wedding experience by keeping track of significant dates.

Before the wedding, the page displays a countdown timer, building anticipation as it counts down to the big day. This feature helps keep guests excited and informed about the upcoming event. After the wedding, the countdown timer shifts focus, counting down the time remaining until the next anniversary. This functionality ensures that the couple will never forget their special day, as the page continually reminds them of their anniversary.

By leveraging SvelteKit and Cloudflare, the project benefits from a fast, responsive user interface and reliable backend services. The use of Cloudflare's database for storing invitation numbers ensures that each guest receives a unique and personalized invitation. This combination of technologies provides a seamless and enjoyable experience for both the couple and their guests.
