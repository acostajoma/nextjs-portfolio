## Overview

Rids.agency is a family-owned real estate website I developed to provide transparent and personalized property solutions. Combining my background in business administration and two years of web development, I leveraged technology to create a seamless real estate experience. My journey into real estate began with a serendipitous encounter, leading to the creation of this platform driven by integrity and excellence.

To build Rids.agency, I used a modern tech stack that includes Svelte, SvelteKit, Prisma, MongoDB, and Cloudflare. Svelte and SvelteKit were chosen for their fast, reactive, and user-friendly capabilities, enabling a smooth frontend experience. Prisma served as an efficient ORM for managing our database, while MongoDB provides the flexibility and scalability needed for storing property listings and client information in the future. Cloudflare was instrumental in ensuring the website's performance, security, and reliability.

In addition to developing the platform, I worked closely with my family to leverage their expertise. My wife, a dedicated pharmacist with data management skills, supported our analytical operations. My mother, an experienced lawyer, ensured legal compliance in all transactions, and my father, with over 15 years in real estate, brought invaluable knowledge in property sales and development.

At Rids.agency, we aim to help clients find their ideal properties in Costa Rica through a transparent and honest approach. By considering the emotional, spiritual, and professional aspects of our clients' lives, we strive to create solutions that contribute to a happier, more fulfilling life.
